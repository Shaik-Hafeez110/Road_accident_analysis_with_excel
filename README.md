# 🚦 Road Accidents Analysis Dashboard With Excel

## 📌 Project Objective  
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing road accident data across multiple factors such as **accident severity, vehicle type, road type, lighting condition, and area type (urban/rural)**.  
The goal is to identify accident patterns and provide actionable insights for road safety improvement and policy-making.

## 🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
1. What is the total number of casualties?  
2. How many casualties fall under **Fatal, Serious, and Slight severity** categories?  
3. Which **vehicle type** is responsible for the highest number of casualties?  
4. What is the **monthly trend** of casualties between (2021 vs 2022)?  
5. Which **road type** has the most casualties?  
6. What is the impact of **road surface conditions** (Dry, Wet, Snow)?  
7. How do accidents vary between **Urban and Rural areas**?  
8. How do accidents vary based on **light conditions (Day vs Night)?**

## 🛠️ Process  
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for consistency.  
- Created **Pivot Tables** for aggregating accident data.  
- Designed interactive charts and visuals using:  
  - **Donut Charts** → Severity, Light, Area-wise breakdown  
  - **Line Chart** → Monthly trend (2021 vs 2022)  
  - **Bar Chart** → Casualties by Road Type  
  - **Tree Map** → Road Surface condition  
  - **Icon-based visuals** → Casualties by Vehicle Type  
- Added **Filter Panel (Slicers and Timelines)** for interactive analysis by Year, Weather, Wind, and Area.  
- Linked icons for easy navigation within the dashboard.

## 🔑 Project Insights  
- **Total Casualties:** 417,881  
- **Severity Split:**  
  - Fatal: 6,734 (1.6%)  
  - Serious: 59,354 (14.2%)  
  - Slight: 351,793 (84.2%)  
- **By Vehicle Type:** Cars cause ~80% of total casualties (333,484).  
- **By Road Type:** Single carriageways are the most dangerous (309.7k casualties).  
- **By Road Surface:** Dry roads dominate accidents, followed by Wet conditions.  
- **Urban vs Rural:** Rural areas (255.9k) record more accidents than Urban areas (162k).  
- **By Light Condition:** Daylight accidents (305k) are nearly 3x higher than Night accidents (113k).  
- **Trend:** Accident counts remained high in summer months (May–Oct) with a dip in December 2022.

## 📌 Final Conclusion  
To reduce accident casualties, authorities should:  
- Focus on **improving single carriageway road safety** with stricter enforcement and infrastructure upgrades.  
- Implement **car safety awareness programs**, since cars contribute to the majority of accidents.  
- Improve **road surface quality** and drainage to prevent wet-road accidents.  
- Prioritize **rural area safety measures**, which contribute more to accidents than urban regions.  
- Launch **road safety campaigns in daylight driving conditions**, since most accidents occur in daytime.
